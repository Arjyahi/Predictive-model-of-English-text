# Predictive model of English text using R Studio and Shiny

The goal of the project is to use the skills acquired in the Data Science specialization in creating an application based on a predictive model for text. Given a word or phrase as input, the application will try to predict the next word. The predictive model will be trained using a corpus, a collection of written texts, called the HC Corpora which has been filtered by language.

This report is an EDA of the training data supplied for the project by Johns Hopkins University and SwiftKey. The Data can be found [here] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip).

In addition to loading and cleaning the data, the aim here is to make use of the NLP packages for R to tokenize n-grams as a first step toward testing a Markov model for prediction.
